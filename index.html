            <p class="paragraph-text">I'm originally from Bloomington, Illinois. I went to Arizona State University to pursue a Business Communications degree. I had the best time out there and made a ton of friends who I'm still in good connection with. Although I met some great people out there, the weather was my favorite part because it made me realise how much I disliked snow, even though the summers could be brutal out there! After college, I made the decision that I wanted to pursue a career in medical sales. In order to reach my goal, I needed to have more sales experience on my resume so I landed my first position as a sales rep with State Farm. Although I did enjoy working a State Farm, it was more call center structure and didn't feel like a sales job where I would actively reach out to people like cold calling. I started a new job after as a recruiter. Unfortunately a month into this new job, Covid hit and I lost my position ,so I decided to move back to my home town where I became a sales rep for a company called Crown. I was on track to landing a medical sales position when I started to really think if this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that's when I made the decision to pursue a career as a developer. Sales was great but I didn't want to constantly stress about reaching sales goals and it is a more cut throat field as in, if you aren't hitting your goals consistently, they will find someone who can. I have always been a gamer my whole life and love to sit down solve problems because of the feeling you get when you finally accomplish them. I have two friends that are currently software developers and they showed me what their day to day work schedule is. I became hooked and started to learn about the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript which led me to create a Github account and try some projects out. After a month or two of this, I made the decision that this is something I want to pursue and that's where I found Coding Temple.<br><br></p>
